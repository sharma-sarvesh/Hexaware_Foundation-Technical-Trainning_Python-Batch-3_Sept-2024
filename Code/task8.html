<!--8. Build a basic shopping cart where users can add items to the cart and view the total price. The page should display available items, and clicking on an item adds it to the cart.
Hints: Use JavaScript objects to store item data (e.g., name, price), onclick event for adding items to the cart, and DOM manipulation to update the cart. -->
